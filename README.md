# **Sendr** (WIP)

Sendr is a basic program that forwards emails received by one account (presumably a sentinel email address) to another (a primary address) using the lettre crate.

When ran, sendr will look through the contents of the sentinel inbox and forward all unread mail to the given primary address and then mark them as read.

**This project is currently a work in progress and is non functioning as of the latest commit.**
